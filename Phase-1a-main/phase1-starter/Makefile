# This is the top-level Makefile for Phase 1. 
#       make            (makes all libraries and all tests)
#		make install	(installs all libraries in ~/lib and headers in ~/include
#		make phase1x	(makes library for phase1x)
#		make phase1x-install (installs phase1x library in ~/lib and headers in ~/include
#
# The build will look for the phase libraries and USLOSS in the following locations in this order:
#
#		~/cs452/lib	-- solutions for phase libraries we've provided
#		~/lib -- libraries you've built and installed
#		<source directory> -- development versions of libraries
#
# For example, phase1b needs libphase1a-X.Y.a, where X.Y is the version number. 
# The build will first look in ~/cs452/lib, then ~/lib, then the phase1a
# subdirectory to find this library. Similarly it will look for the USLOSS library 
# in these locations and should find it in ~/lib if you installed USLOSS correctly.
